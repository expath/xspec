	## <scan> is the document element

collection = 
	## <collection> provides the URL of a collection of documents that will be
	## searched. This is passed to the collection() function. A typical value if
	## you're using Saxon might be:
	## ?select=*.xml&amp;recurse=yes&amp;strip-space=yes
	element collection { xs:anyURI }

find = 
	## <find> provides an XPath that selects the kinds of nodes that should be
	## scanned for. The default (if you don't specify the <find> element) is:
	## //(* | processing-instruction())
	element find { xs:string }

global-id-atts = 
	## <global-id-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes that
	## are globally unique within a particular document. This helps to produce
	## readable XPath expressions in the generated test suite. The default is:
	## id xml:id
	element global-id-atts { list { xs:QName } }

local-id-atts = 
	## <local-id-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes that
	## are unique within a particular parent element. This helps to produce readable
	## XPath expressions in the generated test suite. The default is empty.
	element local-id-atts { list { xs:QName} }

enum-atts = 
	## <enum-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes whose values
	## are enumerated. This helps to produce distinct tests for distinct values of
	## those attributes. The default is empty.
	element enum-atts { list { xs:QName } }

max-examples = 
	## <max-examples> is the maximum number of examples that should be listed.
	## Generally, when examples are listed only the first is actually given in full;
	## the rest are commented out. However, if an element has text content and there
	## are less than max-examples distinct values for that element, all the examples
	## will be listed. If you have textual content that is marked up then you want
	## to set this high; otherwise, set it low. The default is 10.
	element max-examples { xs:integer }
