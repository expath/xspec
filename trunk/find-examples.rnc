# <collection> provides the URL of a collection of documents that will be

# ?select=*.xml&amp;recurse=yes&amp;strip-space=yes

# <find> provides an XPath that selects the kinds of nodes that should be
# scanned for. The default (if you don't specify the <find> element) is:
# //(* | processing-instruction())
find = element find { xs:string }

# <global-id-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes that
# are globally unique within a particular document. This helps to produce
# readable XPath expressions in the generated test suite. The default is:
# id xml:id

# <local-id-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes that

# XPath expressions in the generated test suite. The default is empty.

# <enum-atts> is a space-separated list of the names of attributes whose values
# are enumerated. This helps to produce distinct tests for distinct values of
# those attributes. The default is empty.
enum-atts = element enum-atts { list { xs:QName } }

# <max-examples> is the maximum number of examples that should be listed.
# Generally, when examples are listed only the first is actually given in full;
# the rest are commented out. However, if an element has text content and there
# are less than max-examples distinct values for that element, all the examples
# will be listed. If you have textual content that is marked up then you want
# to set this high; otherwise, set it low. The default is 10.
