#summary A guide for users of XSpec

= Introduction =

XSpec is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development Behaviour Driven Development] (BDD) framework for XML processing, currently focused on [http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20 XSLT].

BDD is like Test Driven Development (TDD) in that it encourages you to develop your code by

 # describing a behaviour (or writing a test)
 # testing whether your code gives that behaviour
 # if it doesn't, fixing the code until it does and the test passes

The difference between BDD and TDD is about how you write the tests. In BDD, your focus is on the behaviour of the code: the descriptions form the double role of both a human-readable documentation of what the code should do and runnable tests that can test whether the code does what it should do.

In BDD, we describe *scenarios* and the expected behaviour of the application with these scenarios. Scenarios fit particularly well with XSLT's source-driven (or template-driven) approach. For example, a scenario might be:

  when processing a `<para>` element, it should create a `<p>` element.

or something more complex like:

  when processing a `<fn>` element with a `label` attribute in `footnote` mode, 
  it should create a `<p>` element with a `<sup>` child holding the value of the `label` element.

Scenarios written like this naturally map onto XSLT templates.
