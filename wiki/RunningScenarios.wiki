#summary How to test whether your stylesheet meets its description

Currently, to run the tests, the [WritingScenarios XSpec description document] is transformed into an XSLT stylesheet which imports the stylesheet being tested. Running _this_ stylesheet results in an XML document that holds the results, which is then transformed into an HTML report. The two stylesheets involved in this process are:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/xspec/source/browse/trunk/generate-xspec-tests.xsl generate-xspec-tests.xsl], to transform the XSpec document into XSLT
  * [http://code.google.com/p/xspec/source/browse/trunk/format-xspec-report.xsl format-xspec-report.xsl], to transform the XML report into HTML

Two scripts are provided that will perform this pipeline for you:

  * [http://code.google.com/p/xspec/source/browse/trunk/xspec.bat xspec.bat] for Windows
  * [http://code.google.com/p/xspec/source/browse/trunk/xspec.sh xspec.sh] for Mac OS X (might work on other *nix-type systems, but untested)

If you develop more scripts (eg ant or XProc pipelines), please share them.
