## XSpec

Version 0.4.0.

XSpec is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for XML
processing, currently focusing on XSLT and XQuery.  It is based on the
Spec framework of RSpec, which is a BDD framework for Ruby.

XSpec consists of a syntax for describing the behaviour of your XSLT
or XQuery code, and some code that enables you to test your code
against those descriptions.

The project owners are Jeni Tennison and Florent Georges.
