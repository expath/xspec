## XSpec

Version 0.4.0.

XSpec is a [Behaviour Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development)
(BDD) framework for XSLT and XQuery.  It is based on the Spec
framework of [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), which is a BDD framework for
Ruby.

XSpec consists of a syntax for describing the behaviour of your XSLT
or XQuery code, and some code that enables you to test your code
against those descriptions.

Maven plugins for running XSpec tests as part of a build are available from [adamretter](http://github.com/adamretter/xspec-maven-plugin) and [daisy](http://github.com/daisy/xspec-maven-plugin).

An external project, [jxsl](http://code.google.com/p/jxsl/), provides
a Maven archetype for XSpec (Ant is expected soon). The goal is to
provide everything needed to integrate with Continuous Integration
tools for Java (like Hudson, Cruise Control, etc.) See Benoit's
[presentation at Balisage 2011](http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol7/html/Mercier01/BalisageVol7-Mercier01.html)
in Montreal for more info.

The project owners are Jeni Tennison and Florent Georges.
