            <p>Schematron is a wonderful tool for testing XML to find out if the XML follows an expected structure.</p>
            <p>In addition to validating XML, Schematron can also raise alerts for things you might want to know through warnings and informational messages. It can pass/fail validation and much more!</p>

            <title>Testing Schematron</title>
            <p>While Schematron is useful for testing XML files, it is also useful to have a tool for testing Schematron itself.</p>
            <p>Schematron is simple to use. However sometimes tests can sometimes become very complex. A good set of test cases can help you to avoid problems and makes your work go faster.</p>
