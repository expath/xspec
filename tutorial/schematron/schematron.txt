Testing Schematron
============================

A unit test framework for Schematron based on XSpec.


Running the tutorial examples
-----------------------------

Before you begin, you may need to set an environment variable to tell XSpec where to find Saxon. For example: 

    set SAXON_CP=C:\Programs\saxon\saxon9he.jar

Using xspec.bat or xspec.sh, use the -s parameter to specify a Schematron Unit Test, and give the path to a Schematron Unit Test file. The demo examples in the tutorial folder can be run by:

    bin\xspec.bat -s tutorial\schematron\demo-01.xspec
    bin\xspec.bat -s tutorial\schematron\demo-02-PhaseA.xspec
    bin\xspec.bat -s tutorial\schematron\demo-02-PhaseB.xspec
    bin\xspec.bat -s tutorial\schematron\demo-03.xspec
    bin\xspec.bat -s tutorial\schematron\demo-04.xspec

Test results will be written to tutorial\schematron\xspec as 

    demo-01-result.html
    demo-02-PhaseA-result.html
    demo-02-PhaseB-result.html
    demo-03-result.html
    demo-04-result.html



Writing tests
-------------

XSpec tests are written in an XML document that adheres to the RelaxNG schema xspec.rnc. 

The root element of a test file is `description`. To test a Schematron schema, the `description` element must have attribute `schematron` which specifies the path to the Schematron file to test. For example:

    <x:description xmlns:x="http://www.jenitennison.com/xslt/xspec" schematron="filename.sch">

Parameters that are specified in `param` elements are passed into the Schematron compilation. If you are testing a Schematron that has multiple phases, you can specify a particular Schematron phase to be tested by adding a `param` element with name "phase" and provide the name of the phase. For example:

    <x:param name="phase">thephase</x:param>

Tests are defined using `scenario` elements. Each scenario should have a label that describes it. Scenarios can be nested, shared, focused, and pending.

    <x:scenario label="description"> 

The `context` element is used to provide XML to be validated by the Schematron for a particular test scenario. The context XML can be provided in a separate file that is specified by an href attribute.

    <x:context href="filename.xml">

Alternatively, context can be given as an XML fragment within the `context` element.

    <x:context>
      <example>any XML</example>
    </x:context>  

Assertions specify the results that are expected when the context XML is validated by the Schematron. Assertions are written using any combination of expect-* elements to specify expected results of running the Schematron on the context XML.

* `expect-valid` - Verify that the Schematron is executed and passes validation. In the Schematron an `assert` or `report` can have a `role` attribute specifying that it is a warning or informational message and these are considered to be allowed for a passing validation. 
* `expect-assert` - Verify that an `assert` is thrown.
* `expect-not-assert` - Verify that an `assert` is not thrown.
* `expect-report` - Verify that a `report` is thrown.
* `expect-not-report` - Verify that a `report` is not thrown.

With the exception of `expect-valid`, the expect-* elements all have attributes to identify an expected `assert` or `report`. These attributes can be used in any combination to specify the expected results of running the Schematron on the context XML: 

* `id` - Identify a specific `assert` or `report` using its `id` attribute or match the `id` attribute of the parent `rule`.
* `role` - Match a specific `role` attribute value of an `assert` or `report` or the parent `rule`. Role attribute values are often used to specify 'error', 'fatal', 'warn', 'warning', 'info', 'information'. 
* `location` - XPath of a location in the context XML that the `assert` or `report` is expected to find. Namespace prefixes that are defined in Schematron using `ns` elements can be used.

For example, say you expect an `assert` with id a0001 to be thrown at XPath location /html[1]/body[1]/div[5]. This assertion would be written as:

    <x:expect-assert id="a0001" location="/html[1]/body[1]/div[5]"/>

Although not required, it is helpful if the `assert` and `report` elements in the Schematron being tested have an `id` attribute. Test scenarios can be more specific by using the id attribute to match expectations to `assert` and `report` elements in the Schematron. (The file quickfix.sch included with the demos is a Schematron Quick Fix that can be used in oXygen to quickly add the id attribute to assert and report elements.)

It is possible to import scenarios from a separate file. This allows more flexibility for organizing your test cases. To import scenarios from another file use the `import` element and specify the XSpec file to import using the `href` attribute. 

    <x:import href="filename.xspec"/>

Anything that can be done in XSpec can be done in a Schematron unit test. It is possible to test XSLT function definitions (xsl:function) that are embedded in a Schematron. A test scenario can also check the SVRL output of Schematron for specific things.

When the test file is executed by XSpec, each scenario will be evaluated by using the Schematron to validate the context XML and then checking the validation result to find out if the result matches the assertions.
